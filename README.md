# CS-Project-one-POS
A take on my first CS project. The goal is to make a constructive front-end only application that calculates and adds items to have a POS (point of sale).
Ideally what I want to gain from this is experience for myself and potential experience for future applications within companies and for myself.
Im aware that java.swing isnt the most ideal GUI, but it is a learning process for myself and for those who may look at my code in the future for their own journeys.
I want to try to make this program as dynamic as I can personally do whilst having fun learning all the different features I can do with swing.
I may update this to more accurately reflect the project but for now this is what I have in this read.me, so thanks for reading!
